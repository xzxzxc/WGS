Professors, post-docs, graduate students and undergraduate students help build detector components, write analysis software, and look for various process signatures in the data (multiparton interactions, top quark physics, heavy flavour physics, particle spectroscopy etc.). The Kyiv high energy group is also involved in major education outreach activities, aimed at spreading an interest in physics and science to kids, and high school students.'%}
